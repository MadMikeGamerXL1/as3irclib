AS3IRClib is a framework not a program, it can be used as a single SWC component

To compile as3irclib under, just go

ant

In the root directory, a as3irclib.swc will be created.

If not, check build.xml file.  You might try changing the
"build.build.properties" option to define FLEX 2 SDK framework path.


You can also compile documentation:

ant as3docs
